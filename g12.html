Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge...</p><div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>This opening demonstrates the Creature's intense existential despair and rage against Victor Frankenstein, highlighting the central theme of creator and creation. <span class="bibl">Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, 1818.</span></div><p>When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings...</p><div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Shelley's use of natural imagery (the "cold stars" and "bare trees") contrasts the Creature's inner turmoil, reinforcing the Romantic preoccupation with nature's indifference. <span class="bibl">Critical Source: Mellor, Anne K. "Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters," 1988.</span></div><p>The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day...</p><div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>The Creature's reflection on his "imprudence" emphasizes his capacity for moral reasoning, challenging assumptions about his monstrosity. <span class="bibl">Secondary Source: Cantor, Paul A.
