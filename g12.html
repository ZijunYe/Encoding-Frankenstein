But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued— </p><p><span class="said">‘You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede. ’</span></p><p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and, as he said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me. </p><p><span class="said">‘I do refuse it’</span>, I replied; <span class="said">‘and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me <span class="term" id="base">base</span> in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.’</span></p><p><span class="said">‘You are in the wrong, ’</span> replied the fiend; <span class="said">‘and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of <span class="term" id="abject">abject</span> slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my <span class="term" id="arch-enemy">arch-enemy</span>, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.

If any being felt emotions of <span class="term" id="benevolence">benevolence</span> towards me, I should return them an hundred and an hundred fold; for that one creature's sake, I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless, and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!

My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty.

My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! my life will flow quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my maker. ’</span></p><p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. </p><p><span class="said">‘You swear,’</span> I said, <span class="said">‘to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?

My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of existence and events, from which I am now excluded. ’</span></p><div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Feint: noun; a deceptive action or movement designed to mislead an opponent.

I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I concluded that the <span class="term" id="justice02">justice</span> due both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said—</p><p><span class="said">‘I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile. ’</span></p><div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>"Justice" in this context highlights Victor's recognition of his dual obligations: to the Creature as his creator and to humanity as a fellow being. According to Anne K. Mellor in "Making a Monster", this moment reveals Victor's internal conflict between fulfilling his ethical responsibility as a creator and safeguarding the interests of society. (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Making a Monster</span>, <span class="author">Anne K.

Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear. ’</span></p><p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the <span class="term" id="sea-of-ice">sea of ice</span>.</p><p>His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the half-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly; and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, <span class="said">‘Oh! stars and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness. ’</span></p><p>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the <span class="term" id="eternal-twinkling">eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me</span>, and how I listened to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly <span class="term" id="siroc">siroc</span> on its way to consume me.</p><p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain's weight, and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream; and that thought only had to me the reality of life. </p><div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>"sea of ice": refers to the Mer de Glace glacier in the Swiss Alps, symbolizing isolation and the sublime force of nature.
